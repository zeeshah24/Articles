SharePoint List for Power Apps

Pros:
•	Most used as data source (~70%) for Power Apps
•	No premium licencing reqd (included in Microsoft 365 licenses, no additional cost)
•	Dataverse falls under the banner of a premium connector, requiring a license, any Power App or Power 	Automate license such as the Per app or Per user plans include access to Dataverse. 
•	Better than excel
•	Little learning curve
•	For smaller, simpler lists within an application we would say that SharePoint lists come out as the 		better option between the two.

Cons:
•	Power apps to pass the credential to SharePoint— for access
•	Some RDBMS features missing: Record Locking etc
•	Importing is not smooth
•	Give lot of issues if the column renamed.
•	It’s been around 20 yrs, and it is not for PowerApps
•	For bigger projects, solutions and applications that expect to scale, then Dataverse would be the 		better route to take.
